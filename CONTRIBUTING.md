1. Each pull request must show a regression test against the latest commit. This test requires:
  - LOS > 99%
  - correct code formatting
  - The results of the test must be added to the pull request.

2. Changes to the code should be commented and explained inside the code.
3. We do not like to copy code from other engines.
4. If there is an idea coming from another engine, this must be stated inside the code.
