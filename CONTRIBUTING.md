1. Each pull request must show a regression test against the latest commit on master. Conditions for the regression test to accept are the following:
   - a SPRT test with bounds [-0.25, 1.25] must get an LLR of atleast 2.94
2. Changes to the code should be commented and explained inside the code.
3. We do not like to copy code from other engines.
4. If there is an idea coming from another engine, this must be stated inside the code.
